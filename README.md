# Snake
A small game of Snake made in Python for my Fundamentals of Programming class

The snake is represented by +(plus) sings for the body and a *(asterisk) for the head, while the a's on the board are apples.
The snake's direction can be changed with the commands 'up'/'down'/'left'/'right', and it will move in the selected direction with the 'move' command.
Everytime the snake eats an apple, the body grows and another apple appears on the board. 
The size of the board can be ajusted by changing the parameters in the settings.txt file
